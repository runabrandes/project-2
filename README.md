## PROJECT IDEA

My idea for Project 2 stems from my interest in Geography and travelling. I wanted to create a fun and easy to understand quiz that focuses on facts from around the globe.

  The features I wanted the game to have are:

* Quiz navigations and controls are easy to understand
* Simple but nice to look at design that fits the topic of the quiz
* Website gives feedback dependig on user input
